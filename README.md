# Brief Summary of Project

Our project will recommend recipes to users based off of their cravings. They can search up an ingredient, dish, restaurant, or type of cuisine and get a collection of recipes that would fit their needs. If we have additional time to build our project, we will integrate a third, shopping API in order to give our users a total ingredient cost for making a certain dish, and perhaps offer that as a ranking option.
